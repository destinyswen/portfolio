        <p class="secondheading">Childhood</p>

        <p class="secondparagraph">I was raised by a immigrant family who came from West Africa, Liberia. My parents decided to move to the United States in 1998 and they decided to live in Brooklyn, New York where I ended up being born. As my early childhood years, my parents decided that it would be the best to move to Minnesota instead of staying in New York.</p>

        <p class="secondparagraph2">As a child, I fell in love with anything entertainment related. I  was obsessed with anything Disney channel, obessed with the movies me and my father would watch from Blockbusters every week and I was even obsessed with the movie posters my father would also get me for my room. Something about the media playing on the TV always made me glued to the screen.</p>

        <p class="thridheading">Teenage Years</p>

        <p class="thridparagraph">As I was getting into my early teen years, the strict African roles become stronger on top of me as I became the oldest sibling to my brothers and sisters and to I’ve always had ran to certain types of media to help me escape from those extreme roles put against me and I wanted to start expressing myself by creating my own type pieces of artwork. The only problem was that I only went to white predominated schools and the media that I was really interested in was made for and by more western media and that was the only things I mimic in my artwork.</p>

        <p class="thridparagraph2">I started creating drawings, writing my own music, writting my own scripts and created my own YouTube channel with all of my fan fiction stories. I was just inspired by everything that I grew up watching and I wanted to be just like the things I saw on the screen.</p>

        <p class="fourthheading">Adulthood</p>

        <p class="fourthparagraph">As I got older, I notice there was a certain shift in western media when it came to diversity and inclusion. I started seeing more stories, music and artwork being created by people of all types of backgrounds and the recongition people were giving them and it inspired me to change the way I think about creating art. I overall got tired of writing stories solely based white backgrounds and wanted to start expressing my true self when it came to my artwork.</p>

        <p class="fourthparagraph2">I decided that I after high school, I wanted to go to school for enhance my technique and take designing more seriously. I wanted to create more artwork that can reach other people who has lived the same experiences as me and understand the core reason why I am even so passionate about creating things. I believe that art is the only way that can understand and express the basics of the human experiences and it has help me connect to people in all different types of backgrounds and walks of life and I would love to continue expressing my passion and creating things made for people like me.</p>

<p class="projecttext">These posters were created for a project where students had the chance to create social justice issues posters based on anything that is going on in today’s society. I decided that I wanted to focus on harmful stereotypes towards black women because as being a black women myself, we have to deal with the most negative stereotypes towards any type of group in society. I decided to use the main stereotypes that I have seen about black women, which are the mammy, the strong black women and the ghetto loud girl and I decided to use myself within these posters because I wanted to express the pain that I have personally felt as being named these stereotypes throughout my life and wanted my classmates to understand the type of pain that I even go through as a black women. </p>

    <div class="stoutposter6"></div>

<p class="projecttext2">The first two posters were practice event posters that me and other classmates were tasked to do to get into creating posters for certain events. The first poster was focused on celebrating women who were main leads in the film industry and I wanted to create a fun contrast with the yellow and red colors on the poster and take important scenes where women show their dominance and power to pull the message together. The second poster was to create a Las Vegas theme style and I decided that I wanted to create icons that people would recognize at a casino since casinos are Las Vegas’s trademark and I wanted it to fit within the neon aesthetic. The last four posters was made because I was an apart of an event organization on campus and I was the graphic designer in the group. I created a few different designs for our <i class="italic 1">“Mask-Querade”</i> dance and our group wanted to create a fun event where students who weren’t able to go to prom because of covid, could be able to live out a fun night similar to prom. Since the success of the mask-querade dance, we decided to create another big event mainly focused on Hollywood and dressing up as your favorite celebrity, which was also a hit on campus as well.</p>

<p class="projecttext3">In my marketing class, groups were task to take pre-existing product and try to rebrand them to make them more appealing for customers. I was apart of a group project where focused on the brand <i class="italic 2">"Aura Bora"</i>, which is a sparking healthy drink. In the group, it was my job to help create social media designs of our re-branding and I decided that I wanted to highlight the artwork of the bottle and the healthy things that their drinks has to make it more fun and appealing for our target demographic.</p>

<p class="projecttext4">When I was in a typography course, one of our projects were us creating something relating to a calendar and time. I decided that I wanted to focus my calendar based on astrology since I personally am a big fan of the whole idea with astrology and believe that you can use that idea to my advantage. I decided to make it more women-based in astrology and make it into more of a fantasy aesthetic to help make my calendar stand out from the rest.</p>

<p class="projecttext5">For my graphic design course, we were tasked to take an already pre-existing brand and create it into something new. I decided to re-brand <i class="italic 3">“Wet-n-Wild”</i> because I personally felt like the overall brand was kind of boring and not too interesting to look at. I decided to make the brand more experimental and expressive since I believe when it comes to makeup, it is a chance for you to create whatever you would want if your makeup looks and you don’t have to play it safe. I wanted to change it to <i class="italic 4">"Viper"</i> instead and create a more street style designs to pull together that expression that I wanted the brand to have.</p>

<p class="projecttext6">This project was a formal introduction into logo mark making, or more broadly sign or symbol making. The task that we had to do was make more dynamic and naturalistic marks with effective meaning and strong aesthetics. The project was limited to two-dimensional shapes and no additional wordmarks. I decided to make a symbol related to society and imagine this symbol being a representation for any organization or company that wants to bring any awareness about society and how we have to always bring a certain persona in front of everyone I’ll were hurting inside and I wanted to see what this simple design would look like on multiple mock-ups.</p>

<p class="projecttext7">Another project that I made for my typography course was creating a visual representation based on a podcast and make it into a booklet. I decided to take inspiration from a podcast group called <i class="italic 5">“99% Invisible”</i> with their episode 435 called <i class="italic 6">“The Megaplex”</i>. The whole podcast episode was about the history of the movie theater and the popularity that movies had with audiences. I wanted my designs to be every movie that was popular around each time period and make the reader feel like they are experiencing these same movies just like the people who went to the movie theater for the first time.

<p class="projecttext8">Another project from my graphic design course was again, re-branding an existing brand and changing it into a unique and creative take. I decided to re-create the video game brand <i class="italic 7">“Capcom”</i>. The reason why I decided to pick that specific game brand is because I feel like the original logo was fine but I wanted to further the design a little bit more. I decided to change the logo into a Japanese style aesthetic since the company was created in japan and wanted to keep that same cultural aspect. I also wanted to experiment on how the logo could look like with different mock-up backgrounds.</p>

    <p class="msstext">I was a student graphic designer for an office on campus called Multicultural Student Services. The office goals were to help out students who come from different racial backgrounds and create safe spaces for them to talk to different office advisors and reach out for financial support. My job as the graphic designer was to take design requests from advisors in the office who might be helping out with certain org’s events or creating their own special events throughout the school year me.</p>

    <p class="bsutext">I was apart of a multicultural org called black student union, or BSU for short and I was the treasurer and graphic designer for the group. One of the first designs that I worked on was the re-design of the BSU logo. I wanted to recreate the logo because everyone felt like the logo was overplayed with the same green, yellow and red design and I wanted to be more simple but nicer and that helps represents the diversity of black people since we all come from different shades.</p>

<p class="bsutext3">These designs are the merchandise that I created for our spring backyard bash. Backyard bash is an event that happens twice in the school year where all of the clubs and orgs on campus sets a table up and promotes their club and what they represent to new students and I decided that I wanted to create new merchandise for BSU which includes stickers, keychains and button designs for our club members.</p>

<div class="bsuproject15"></div>
<div class="bsuproject16"></div>

<p class="bsutext4">These are another set of designs that I created for backyard bash but for fall semester instead. The first one is for a banner that I created for our table and I decided to make the banner have different shades of brown to represent different types of black people and the second one is just a sticker version of the banner that I made.</p>

<div class="bsuproject17"></div>
<div class="bsuproject18"></div>

<p class="bsutext5">The club wanted to have a fundraiser to help fund the organization a little bit more with future events and we decided to sell Mac and cheese and Hot wings to our club members. I wanted to design a fun sticker for the packaging and I wanted the design to match some of the food that we were selling.</p>

<div class="bsuproject19"></div>

<p class="bsutext6">Since we’ve notice that we had a lot of upcoming graduates leaving our org and we our campus advisor made an idea that we should create our own stole for any future upcoming graduates. These would give a chance for people were apart of the club can wear for their graduation and have a special piece of memory of black student union.</p>

    <p class="uxtext">For my UX healthcare course, we had to use our skills with UI/UX and create an healthcare product that is user friendly. I decided to I have decided to go with my proposal of creating a mental health clinic based on black mental illness. The reason why I decided to go this route is because growing up, I have always dealt with my own trauma as a black women and the main problem was it was never seen as serious. I’ve also notice how in the black community, a lot of people downplay mental illness and make it seem like black people can never deal with mental illnesses while with other races, people pay more attention and valid their illness. I decided that I wanted to create a safe space for black people to go to when they feel helpless and have no one in  our community and for my first phase of my project, I wanted to start creating my personas for people who would need something like this.</p>

    <p class="uxtext3">Going through my previous phases, I personally felt like I wasn’t doing enough effort to help develop the next step of the process, so I decided that I wanted to go into more deeper research based on black african culture. During my research, I found some new information into African culture that felt more authentic that I wanted to use in the next process and also did research on of different colors when it comes to health and what types of colors mean to people when it comes to associating safety in.</p>

My client told me that he wanted a logo that has his gaming tag, <i class="italic 8">“RegisMark_5”</i> but he wanted to make sure the logo would be related to gaming in some way. These designs are my rough drawings of a possible logo based with the information that I was given.</p>

    <div class="gameproject23"></div>
    <div class="gameproject24"></div>

    <p class="gametext4">After working with my client for a few days, we talked about how we can related the logo to gaming because there was still not connection through the previous drawings. While having our conversation, we taught it would be a good idea to make the logo shaped like a cube, inspired by the gaming company <i class="italic 9">“Game Cube”</i> logo from the early 2000s. The first logo without the chrome is something he can use to put on other things for possible merchandise and the chrome logo is specially for the twitch channel profile.</p>

    <p class="beautytext2">After going through my rough drawings, I taught it would be a cool idea to create the rose into a braid to help tie into the hair aspect of the brand and I wanted it to still have it shaped as a rose to keep the aspect of the beauty and make it still related to her favorite film. I didn’t know how I wanted the logo to be placed so I have different versions of the logo, just to see what it would look like.</p>

    <p class="LITtext">An organization called Leaders Igniting transformation, LIT for short contacted me because they wanted me to help them out with their upcoming senate meeting, where they will protest for affordable funding for low income schools in the Wisconsin state. They notice my design work and they wanted to work with each other to create some poster and t-shirt designs for their upcoming meeting. These two images are from their previous protest and just a reference of what they have used before and just for me to have a reference.</p>

    <p class="seniortext">For my final project before graduation, my graduating class had to focus on our big senior show, which is a event where we create our own company brand and showcase them to the entire campus. The theme for the show that year was wellness and these were my original ideas that I was thinking of doing. I wanted to make sure that I created something that I can personally can relate to so I can personally bring in more passion into the project, since I didn’t want it to feel not genuine and it comes from a place from heart.</p>

    <p class="seniortext2">For my project, I decided that I wanted to focus on sexual health, especially towards men. The reason why I decided to make my target audience men is because for years, there was been a stigma that if a male got contacted with an STI, it’s usually their female partners fault or there is more judgement towards women for sexual health and making sure that they are informed with anything but a lot of people in my class asked, what about men? Why aren’t men getting this much pressure like they are for women, so I decided that I wanted that to be the whole focus. For my first phase of the project, I create my empathy maps and they were based on different types of men and them being in sexual situations.</p>

    <div class="seniorproject7"></div>
    <div class="seniorproject8"></div>
    <div class="seniorproject9"></div>

    <p class="seniortext3">These are my personas inspired by my empathy maps. Based on all of the research that I did to listen to real men stories experiencing questioning and confusion situations when it comes to sex, I wanted to make sure my personas felt authentic and like a real life situations that men could experience.</p>

    <div class="seniorproject10"></div>
    <div class="seniorproject11"></div>

    <p class="seniortext4">For my branding process, I decided that I wanted my project to have a unique look when focusing on sexual wellness. I decided to create an “out of this world“ theme experience since in our society, sex is still such a taboo subject and it hard for men to express themselves when they need help sexually. I decided to use more abstract space imagery to help get the point across on making men feel like they are on a new world to explore sexuality. This will also help them to get more comfortable to get educated when it comes to get tested for STIU/STD’S, Sexual Dysfunction and aftercare and not feel any judgement, a app where they to feel like they are in their own space to feel free.</p>

    <p class="seniortext5">These are some of the names that I was thinking for my sexual wellness project but it was a huge struggling in when it came to picking a good name. The reason why I was struggling so much was because I wanted it to be a fun name that can still relate to sex. Later on after doing more research with name branding, I decided to go with <i class="italic">“Just A Tip”</i>, since it was a funny title that can still get the point across for being target towards men.</p>

    <p class="seniortext6">These are my campaign posters to help promote my sexual wellness app. I decided to make the drawings more abstract and to fit into the out of this world experience just by looking at them but still having them relating towards sex. I also wanted to make the text into different facts about sex and giving them a tip afterwards, to fit in with the logo name.</p>

        <p class="seniortext8">For the last phases of the project, I decided that I wanted to push myself future into making it feel like a real company and I decided to make videos for my brand. I decided to create a logo video through adobe after effects and I decided to make fake commercials about different types of tips for men when it comes to their sexual health. The picture on the right is my setup for senior show and how everything looked being put together. Overall, this project was one of the most fun I’ve personally had when creating a project and I will have nothing but amazing memories throughout my process.</p>

    <p class="heatdancetext">After graduation, I applied for a summer internship program with a company named <i class="italic">"Heat Dance"</i>. Heat Dance is an online company focused on dance/workout type tutorials and nutrition diets. Throughout the summer, they made us create some fun logo designs for their upcoming video projects, each one having a different theme to the next. This logo design was inspired by a sleepover dance tutorial and I wanted my logo to have fun feminine colors.</p>

    <div class="heatdanceproject3"></div>

    <p class="heatdancetext2">This logo was inspired by their dance tutorial video called villains. I decided to use black and red colors, since those are the type of colors associated with evil things, just like a villain and I wanted to make my font more thicker, since more bold fonts stand out and come off as imitating.</p>

    <div class="heatdanceproject4"></div>

    <p class="heatdancetext3">This logo design was for their summer inspired beach dance and I wanted my logo to have that same aesthetic as Malibu. I decided to use fun colors associated with summer and the beach and I wanted have an image in the middle of the logo to be shaped as body type but to also make it into a sunset.</p>

    <div class="heatdanceproject5"></div>

    <p class="heatdancetext4">This logo design was created for their dance video titled Latin Heat. I decided for my logo, I wanted to make sure that the colors match the aesthetic of latin dance culture and I decided to draw out a rose going through the letters and made the flower be on fire to spice up the logo even more.</p>

    <div class="heatdanceproject6"></div>

    <p class="heatdancetext5">While being apart of the design program, we were also tasked to created different types of workout posters for their collection. I decided that I wanted to design the cover for their Malibu collection.</p>

    <div class="heatdanceproject7"></div>

    <p class="heatdancetext6">Throughout the program, we were also tasked to design video covers for upcoming dance tutorials. I decided to work on the video title for their dance “Barbie Girl”. I got inspiration from the upcoming film “Barbie” promotional posters and I decided to create something similar with the color palette and with having the dancers glowing as if they were special dancing barbies.</p>
